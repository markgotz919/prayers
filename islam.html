    <h2>I Come to Him Running</h2>

        The Prophet said,
    </p>    
    <p>
        God Most High has said:
        <br />
       When my worshipper's thoughts turn to Me,
        <br />
        there am I with him.
        <br />
        And when he makes mention of Me within himself, 
        <br />
        I make mention of him within Myself:
        <br />
        and when he makes mention of Me in company,
        <br />
        I make mention of him in a better company.
        <br />
        If he draw near to Me a hand's breadth,
        <br />
        I draw near to him an arm's length;
        <br />
        and if he draw near to me an arm's length,
        <br />
        I draw near to him the length of both arms 
        <br />
        wide outstetched;
        <br />
        and if he comes to Me walking, I come to him running. 
        <br />
        And if he meet Me with sins equivalent to the whole world,
        <br />
        I will greet him with forgiveness equal to it.  
    </p>
