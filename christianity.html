    <h2>The Prayer of Saint Francis</h2>
    <img id="francis" src="stfrancis.jpg" style="width:25%;height:25%">
   
    <p>
        Lord make me an instrument of your peace;
        <br />
        where there is hatred, let me sow love;
        <br />
        where there is injury, pardon;
        <br />
        where there is discord, union;
        <br />
        where there is doubt, faith;
        <br />
        where there is dispair, hope;
        <br />
        where there is darkness, light;
        <br />
        where there is sadness, joy;
    </p>
    <p>
        O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
        <br />
        to be consoled as to console,
        <br />
        to be understood as to understand,
        <br />
        to be loved as to love.
        <br />
        For it is in giving that we receive, 
        <br />
        it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
        <br />
        and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
        <br />
        Amen.

     <p>
         Our Father who art in heaven,
         <br />	
         hallowed be thy name. 
         <br />	
         Thy kingdom come. 
         <br />	
         Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. 
         <br />	
         Give us this day our daily bread, 
         <br />	
         and forgive us our trespasses, 
         as we forgive those who trespass against us,
         <br />	
         and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. 
         <br />
